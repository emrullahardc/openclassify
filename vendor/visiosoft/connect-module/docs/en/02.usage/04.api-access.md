### API Access

This section will go over accessing your API.

#### Authorizing Requests

API routes are protected by Passport. API consumers should specify their access token as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header of their request.

For example, when using the Guzzle HTTP library:

    $response = $client->request('GET', '/api/entries/pages/pages', [
        'headers' => [
            'Accept' => 'application/json',
            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $accessToken,
        ],
    ]);
