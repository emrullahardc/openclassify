### Installation

The Connect module is a paid addon and requires purchasing from the addon store or an active PRO subscription.

##### Installing with PRO Subscription

You can install the Connect module with Composer as a VCS repository if you have an active PRO subscription:

    {
         "require": {
            "visiosoft/connect-module": "~1.0.0"
        },
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/anomalylabs/api-module"
            }
        ]
    }

Then simply install for your application:

    php artisan addon:install visiosoft.module.connect

##### Installing from Store Download

You can install the Connect module by downloading the addon and placing it within your site's addon directory:

    /addons/{application_ref}/anomaly/*

Next, copy the `requirements` section of the Connect module's `composer.json` file into your project's `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "laravel/passport": "~1.0.0"
    }

Then run composer update to bring in Passport:

    composer update

Finally install the addon with the `addon:install` command:

    php artisan addon:install visiosoft.module.connect
