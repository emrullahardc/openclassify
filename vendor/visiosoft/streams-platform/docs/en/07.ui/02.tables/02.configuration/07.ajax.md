# Ajax Tables

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

You can easily make tables use ajax behavior by setting the `ajax` property.

```php
protected $ajax = true;
```

You can also flag tables as ajax on the fly.

```php
$builder->setAjax(true);
```

Ajax tables are designed to be included in a modal by default but you can configure it to display using options or however you like.

> **In Development:** The Ajax API is still being developed. While ajax tables are usable, more robust JSON response information is still missing.{.note}
