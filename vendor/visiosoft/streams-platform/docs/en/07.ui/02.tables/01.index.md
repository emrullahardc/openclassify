# Table Builders

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Table builders are responsible for all front-end and control panel tables. They let you easily list model objects.

Typically they are used in conjunction with `streams` but are versatile enough to accommodate API driven/non-model tables as well as fully manual assembly.
