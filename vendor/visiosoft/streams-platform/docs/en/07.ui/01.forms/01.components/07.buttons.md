# Buttons

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

Form `buttons` extend base UI buttons and allow you to add simple button links to your form.

Form buttons do not submit the form like actions do.

```php
protected $buttons = [
    'cancel',
    'view',
];
```

Form buttons extend UI `buttons` so you may want to refer to [button documentation](../../ui/buttons) for a complete set of options for buttons.
