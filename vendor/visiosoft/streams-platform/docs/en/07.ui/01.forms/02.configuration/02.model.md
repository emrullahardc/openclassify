# Model

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

The `model` property is used to determine the form repository to use for data storage and can provide stream information for form entries.

The `model` property guessed by default based on the form builders class. If using `php artisan make:stream` then the model property does not need to be set explicitly.

You can set the model to use manually using the `model` property.

```php
protected $model = \Anomaly\UsersModule\User\UserModel::class;
```

You can set this dynamically too:

```php
$builder->setModel(\Anomaly\UsersModule\User\UserModel::class);
```
