# Read-only

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Introduction

To render the form as read-only just set the `readOnly` flag on the builder.

```php
protected $readOnly = true;
```

You can also set this flag on the fly.

```php
$builder->setReadOnly(true);
```

```twig
{{ form('test', 'example').readOnly(true).render()|raw }}
```
